Here's a breakdown of potential issues and how to address them:\n\n1.  **Expo CLI Version Mismatch:** Ensure your global Expo CLI version matches the Expo SDK version (54) used in your project. You can update the Expo CLI using: `npm install -g expo-cli`. After updating, try running `expo doctor` in your project directory to identify any potential version conflicts or dependency issues.\n\n2.  **Dependency Conflicts:** React Native projects can be sensitive to dependency versions. Check for conflicting or outdated packages. Try deleting your `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` or `yarn install` again to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed based on your `package.json` file.\n\n3.  **Metro Bundler Issues:** The Metro bundler might be failing to bundle your JavaScript code correctly. Try clearing the Metro bundler cache by running `expo start -c` or `yarn start -c`. This forces Metro to rebuild the bundle from scratch.\n\n4.  **Code Errors:** A syntax error or runtime error in your JavaScript/TypeScript code can prevent the app from loading. Carefully review your recent code changes, especially in the `app/(tabs)/wordChallenge/index.tsx` file, and check for any typos or logical errors. Use `console.log` statements to debug your code and identify the source of the error.\n\n5.  **Expo Go App Version:** Make sure you have the latest version of the Expo Go app installed on your mobile device. Outdated versions can sometimes cause compatibility issues.\n\n6.  **Network Connectivity:** Ensure your development machine and mobile device are connected to the same network and that there are no firewall restrictions preventing communication between them.\n\n7.  **Project Structure:** Verify that your project structure adheres to Expo's conventions. Double-check that your `app.json` or `app.config.js` file is correctly configured.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, please provide the error messages you're seeing in the Expo Go app or the Metro bundler console. This will help me diagnose the problem more effectively.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-21T02:45:32.536564"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you troubleshoot why your project isn't loading correctly on Expo Go.
