Create a new screen for the word challenge game.\n2.  Implement the game logic, including letter selection, word validation, and scoring.\n3.  Add a timer to track the player's progress.\n4.  Design the user interface with the specified color palette and typography.\n5.  Add navigation from the home screen to the word challenge screen.\n\nHere is the plan:\n\n1.  Create a new file `app/(tabs)/wordChallenge/index.tsx` for the word challenge screen.\n2.  Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` to add a button that navigates to the word challenge screen.\n3.  Implement the word challenge game logic in `app/(tabs)/wordChallenge/index.tsx`.\n4.  Implement the timer in `app/(tabs)/wordChallenge/index.tsx`.\n5.  Implement the scoring system in `app/(tabs)/wordChallenge/index.tsx`.\n6.  Style the components in `app/(tabs)/wordChallenge/index.tsx` using the specified color palette and typography.\n\nAfter the coding agent implements the plan, the modalDemos array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-21T02:32:46.910290"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a word game with time challenges!
